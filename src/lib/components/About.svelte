  <div>
    <p class="text-slate-400 mb-4">
      I'm an <strong class="text-slate-200">educator</strong> and <strong class="text-slate-200">technologist</strong> passionate about project-based 
      learning and the transformative role of technology in education.
      In my teaching practice, I design <strong class="text-slate-200">hands-on, practical experiences</strong> 
      that help students apply theoretical knowledge through real-world 
      projects. <br><br>
      Outside the classroom, I enjoy learning new languages, playing 
      soccer, and building software projects that explore my interests 
      in <strong class="text-slate-200">automation</strong>, <strong class="text-slate-200">web development</strong>, and <strong class="text-slate-200">education</strong>. <br><br>
      This website is a curated showcase of the projects I’ve created—from 
      a <strong class="text-slate-200">soccer league management system</strong> and a <strong class="text-slate-200">birthday reminder bot</strong> 
      to a <strong class="text-slate-200">Python course</strong> for high school students. Each project reflects my drive to learn, 
      teach, and solve real problems through thoughtful design and development. <br><br>
